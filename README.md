### Strategy
#### Site Owners Goals

### Scope
As my skillset is at a beginner stage, I have taken a "Minimal Viable Product" approach to this project and I have created a clean single page site which can be easily navigated either by scrolling through each section or by clicking on the links on the navigation bar.  
### Structure
The Game is a single page site broken down into the following sections:

#### <em>Game Sections:</em>
* #### Home - 
  *  
  * 
  * 
 <br>

 * #### Navigation bar -

 </p> 
 
 <br>
 
 
<p align="center">
  <img src="">
    </p>



  
 * #### 404 Error -
   * A 404 error page has been added to redirect users back to the home page.

#### <em>Game Flow</em>
The flow of the site is simple and makes the logical linear progression from : Our Philosophy --> Services --> Contact us.
The user might choose their own route through the page, but the site has been designed to try and maintain their focused interest throughout the journey towards the end goal of completing the contact form and make an enquiry. A call to action button has been added to both the home page, and the services page to allow the user to go directly to the contact section if they wish.

### Skeleton

#### <em>Wireframes</em>

All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.

### Surface
#### <em>Colour Scheme</em>
I chose a simple colour palette to allow the focus to be on the images and the information provided. The background colour alternates between a plain white background and an image. I applied an dark gradient overlay to each background image used throughout the site. This was done to avoid distraction and to draw the users eye to the information sitting on the images. I used the below colours to highlight the navigation links and call to action buttons on the landing page, the services page and the contact page.

* Palette:
                                                                                                      
<p align="center">

</p>
                                                                                                                   
#### <em>Typography</em>
The font-families chosen are Poppins and Lora. For consistency I used Poppins for headings and titles and Lora was used for the sub heading of services and Find us.
#### <em>Imagery</em>
Imagery plays a very important part in the design for this website. I chose bright colourful images that complimented each other on the page while highlighting a fun and enjoyable care service.
