# User Experience

### User Stories
* The user should see a grid style game with 16 cards on display - these cards will have a front and back face.
* The user should be able to click any of the cards which are facing down (not yet flipped) to flip over and try to find a matched pair.
* The user should be able to find the matched pairs by clicking on the cards. If they click two cards and these cards are the same, they match, and the cards remain in thier flipped position , if they don't match they revert back to their previous position of facing down and the user must try again.
* The user should not be able to click on a new card until the previous selected cards have returned to their position of face down.
* The user should be receiving an interactive message at the end of the game when all matched pairs have been found. This message will display the number of moves and the time taken to win the game. 
* The user should be able to close the pop up message at the end of the game with a click on the "Replay" button.

### Strategy
#### Site Owners Goals 
 
<br>

### Scope
As my skillset is at a beginner stage, I have taken a "Minimal Viable Product" approach to this project and I have created a clean single page site which can be easily navigated either by scrolling through each section or by clicking on the links on the navigation bar.  
### Structure
The Game is a single page site broken down into the following sections:

#### <em>Game Sections:</em>
* #### Home - 
  *  
  * 
  * 
 <br>

 * #### Navigation bar - 
   *

 <br>
 
 
<p align="center">

    </p>



  
 * #### 404 Error -
   * A 404 error page has been added to redirect users back to the home page.

#### <em>Game Flow</em>
The flow of the site is simple and makes the logical linear progression from : Our Philosophy --> Services --> Contact us.
The user might choose their own route through the page, but the site has been designed to try and maintain their focused interest throughout the journey towards the end goal of completing the contact form and make an enquiry. A call to action button has been added to both the home page, and the services page to allow the user to go directly to the contact section if they wish.

### Skeleton

#### <em>Wireframes</em>

All Wireframes were designed for laptop/computer, iPad/tablet and phone display.

### Surface
#### <em>Colour Scheme</em>
I chose a simple colour palette to allow the focus to be on the images and the information provided. The background colour alternates between a plain white background and an image. I applied an dark gradient overlay to each background image used throughout the site. This was done to avoid distraction and to draw the users eye to the information sitting on the images. I used the below colours to highlight the navigation links and call to action buttons on the landing page, the services page and the contact page.

* Palette:
                                                                                                      
<p align="center">                                                                                           
 <img src="">
</p>
                                                                                                                   
#### <em>Typography</em>
The font-families chosen are Poppins and Lora. For consistency I used Poppins for headings and titles and Lora was used for the sub heading of services and Find us.
#### <em>Imagery</em>
Imagery plays a very important part in the design for this website. I chose bright colourful images that complimented each other on the page while highlighting a fun and enjoyable care service.
