# User Experience

## User Stories
* The user should see a grid style game with cards on display - these cards will have a front and back image.
* The user should be able to click any two cards which are facing down (not yet flipped) to flip over and try to find a matched pair.
* The user should be receiving a message to confirm their win at the end of the game when all matched pairs have been found.  
* The user should be able to close the pop up message at the end of the game with a click on the "x" button.
* The user should have the option to reset the game once completed, the cards will be shuffled and the user can and try to beat their previous time and number of moves taken on thier next try.
* By playing this game the user should be able to test their memory skill in a fun environment.

## Design

The goal of this project is to build a fun memory game where the user can replay as many times as they wish. The game is designed to target a user of any age from younger children who may just want to find the pair regardless of time and moves taken, right up to adults, who may wish to challenge themselves and attempt to beat their own time and moves taken on each game.

The game layout has been kept simple using 16 cards which have been kept to a relatively small size so the game can still look the same in either desktop, tablet or mobile view without having to change the structure completely.

### Overall Feel 

This memory game has been designed to challenge the user within a fun environment. The outer space theme has been used to allow the game to appeal to any age group and it is gender neutral and therefore suitable for anyone to enjoy playing. As the theme is "outer space" - A background of stars in the sky was chosen to give the feeling of being in space and the color scheme was chosen mirror this feeling.

Alien space ships we used as the card back images and each spaceship housed an ailen charactor which was viewed when the card was flipped.

### Color Scheme
The color scheme was chosen to tie in with the outer space theme.

# Features

## Current Features
+ When a player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start and once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
+ A restart button allows the user to reset the game board, the timer and the moves counter.
+ A congratulations modal appears when the user wins the game and matches all 8 pairs.

## Future Features
+ I would like to add different game levels to allow the user to choose an easy, medium or difficuly level of of play.
+ I would like to add sound animation to the game to allow for sound effects to play on click correct flip of card and on completion of game. 
+ I would like to add a mute button to allow the user to control the sound effects.
